# üì¢ CRUD Campaigns

This campaign management system aims primarily to perform a complete maintenance review of pre-established business rules for creating campaigns across various segments.

## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Project Technologies

- ### üê± NestJS (^10.4)
  - NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. It is built with TypeScript and leverages the power of modern JavaScript, providing a modular architecture and dependency injection.
- ### üåà‚É§  Prisma (^5.19)
  - Prisma is an open-source next-generation ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for Node.js and TypeScript. It simplifies database access and provides a type-safe API for working with databases.
- ### ü§° Jest (^29.7)
  - Jest is a delightful JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook, designed to ensure correctness in any JavaScript codebase. It is particularly popular for testing React applications but is versatile enough for any JavaScript project.
- ### üêã Docker
  - Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. It allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into containers, ensuring consistency across different environments.

- When running the project, a /docs route will be available to access the documentation. This route provides an easy way for developers and users to view the API documentation, including endpoints, request/response formats, and any other relevant information about the application's functionality.

## üöÄ Improvements

The system currently presents an MVP of a scalable project for the maintenance and management of an online and/or offline campaign platform. The MVP includes functional routes and precise error handling following the proposed business model. Suggested improvements for the next sprints include:

- A more robust business model for linking campaigns to users.
- A JWT login system with necessary information to ensure that data is stored securely in the database, with encrypted passwords.
- A user-friendly interface following good usability standards, considering Nielsen's heuristics and best UI practices.

## üèãÔ∏è API routes used aiming for a second sprint

##### Note: Consider that /auth will function as middleware to validate user information.

#### Route used to login an user and validating his JWT token

```http
  POST /auth/login
```

| Par√¢metro | Type     | Default Value |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------ |
| `email`    | `string` | example@example.com       |

#### Route to signup a new user

```http
  GET /auth/signup
```

| Par√¢metro | Type     | Default Value |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------ |
| `email`    | `string` | example@example.com       |
| `username`    | `string` | Example Test       |
| `password`    | `string` | Ex@m!ple3      |
